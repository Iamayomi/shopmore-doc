# Security

Security is an important aspect of any restful API that involves user accounts. It allows users to log in and prove their identity, which is critical for keeping the application secure and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information or perform certain actions.

Shopmore Restful API allows us to use authentication to our application, including features such as creating and verifying tokens, storing and retrieving user credentials securely, and implementing OAuth-based authentication with third-party provider.



1.  **Authentication and authorization protocols**

    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system or process. In the context of APIs, it refers to the use of user authentication protocols—like OAuth 2.0, API keys and JWT specifications—to make sure that a requester is who they claim to be.
2.  **Input validation**

    Input validation protocols protect APIs against malicious data, like SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting, by making sure the inputs meet certain criteria (length, type, format, range, etc.) before they’re processed. Utilizing web application firewalls (WAFs) and XML or JSON schema validation can help security teams automate validation processes, preemptively analyzing incoming requests and blocking malicious traffic before it reaches the server. 
3.  **Error handling**

    Proactive error handling in the shopmore API environments can prevent cybercriminals from revealing sensitive information about API processes. the API error will return HTTP status codes that broadly indicate the nature of the error, providing sufficient context for teams to understand and address the problem without risking excessive data exposure. 
4.  **Encryption**

    With encryption, plain text and other types of data are converted from a readable form to an encoded version that can only be decoded by an entity with a decryption key. Using encryption technologies like transport layer security (TLS), SSL connection and TLS encryption protocols, teams can ensure that API traffic won’t be intercepted or altered by bad actors or unauthorized users. 
5.  **Rate limiting**

    Rate limiting secures API resources against brute force and DoS attacks by restricting the number of calls a user or IP address can make within a particular timeframe. Rate limits ensure the API requests are processed promptly and that no user can swarm the system with harmful requests.  
6.  **API gateways**

    API gateways is one of the easiest ways to restrict API access and add an additional layer of network security, especially in the case of open APIs. An API gateway acts as a single point of entry for the API requests a system receives, standardizing API interactions and offering security features like caching, analytics, API composition, rate limiting, encryption, logging and access control.
7.  **Versioning and documentation**

    New version of API software comes with security updates and bug fixes that shore up security gaps in earlier versions. But the proper versioning practices, users can accidentally (or intentionally) deploy an outdated version of the API and put sensitive data in harm’s way. Attentive versioning and documentation practices allow companies to accelerate API development and phase out older API versions without disrupting services, pushing users toward newer, more secure iterations.

    For instance, if a team discovers a security flaw in v1 of an API, they can fix it in v2. And with versioning, security teams can encourage users to migrate from v1 to v2 at their own pace, while making it clear in the version documentation that v1 has a known security vulnerability.&#x20;
8.  **Security testing**

    Security testing requires developers to submit standard requests using an API client to assess the quality and correctness of system responses. Conducting regular security tests to identify and address security gaps helps teams fix API vulnerabilities before attackers have the chance to exploit them.
