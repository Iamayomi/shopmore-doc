Core Concepts:

1. **Product Catalog:**
   * The frontend fetches product data from the backend API, which retrieves it from the database.
   * The frontend displays the product catalog to users.
2. **User Cart:**
   * Users add products to their carts on the frontend.
   * The frontend sends requests to the backend API to update the user's cart in the database.
3. **Checkout Process:**
   * Users proceed to checkout on the frontend.
   * The backend API validates the order, processes the payment through the payment gateway, and updates the order status in the database.
4. **Order Fulfillment:**
   * The backend API triggers order fulfillment processes, such as shipping or digital delivery.
5. **User Management:**
   * Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profile information.
   * The backend API handles user authentication and authorization.

#### Additional Considerations

* **Scalability:** Design the system to handle increasing traffic and data volume. Consider using techniques like load balancing and caching.
* **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent fraud.
* **Performance:** Optimize database queries, use caching, and minimize network latency.
* **Integration:** Integrate with third-party services like email providers, analytics tools, and marketing platforms.
